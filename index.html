		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p class="Experience">Coming into Girls Who Code I was very shy and not that experienced in computer science. I wasn't sure if computer science was going to be something I was looking into to major in. The 1st day I got to know some of the girls in the program and feel comfortable in the program. I felt that this program was going to teach me a lot about the tech behind the computer and also the different types of languages.</p>
