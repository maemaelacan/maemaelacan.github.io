		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		My name is Maelani Lacandazon, I am apart of the Girls Who Code Summer Immerse program in San Francisco. I am a uncoming senior at Leadership Public School in Hayward. I am sixteen and my birthday is on September 2, 1999. I love to play sports like basketball and volleyball. I've been playing basketball since I was in 4th grade and I've played volleyball since 8th grade.

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>
		Coming into Girls Who Code I was very shy and not that experienced in computer science. I wasn't sure if computer science was going to be something I was looking into to major in. The 1st day I got to know some of the girls in the program and feel comfortable in the program. I felt that this program was going to teach me a lot about the tech behind the computer and also the different types of languages.
